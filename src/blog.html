            What we built
          </h4>
          <p>
            I can't say too much about this once because it's internal. But we utilized an array of 
            <b>Estimote beacons</b> to determine positions of users inside a room. Data from the beacons were
            aggregated and displayed to a front-end via <b>heatmap.js</b>.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Technology used:
          </h4>

          </p>
          <h4>
            Takeaways:
          </h4>
          <p>
            The beacons last forever, and they are quite small. They can be hid in various spots and are battery powered.
            In terms of position accuracy they are enough to distinguish someone's position within a couple feet to a beacon.
            <b>Heatmap.js</b> is also a wonderful library that is simple to use. I can see it being used in a lot with maps and location data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team took home <b>Best Themed Category</b>. The other projects we're all incredibly well done. I am amazed
            by some of the engineers in this company.

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <h4>
              What we built
            </h4>
            <p>
              We built a platform in which users could share their knowledge about Arthritis. What surprised us is that many people
              afflicted with Arthritis have an initial trouble building up a knowledge base about the condition, different treatments,
              products and patient support programs. It didn't make sense to us that this problem should exist in the information age.
            
            </p>
            <p>
              We decided to build a knowledge platform that users could submit and rate products, articles and healthcare
              professionals. Kind of like a Yelp for Arthritis.
            </p>
              With four developers on our team, we hit the ground running trying to push as much features we could.
              It was ambitious: a progressive web app in Vue.js, a back-end powered by Firebase, a voice assistant using
              Google's DialogFlow, and a Chrome extension for seamless integration.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end, I put together the Firebase back-end which stored the rating content, as well as handled
              the back-end calls via Google Cloud Functions. I also built the voice assistant.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Technology used:
            </h4>
            <p>
              Vue.js, Firebase Database, Google Cloud Functions (JavaScript), DialogFlow, Chrome Extension Toolkit
            </p>
            <h4>
              Takeaways:
            </h4>
            <p>
              We ended up winning the <b>People's Choice</b> award, which felt great because it was first time I won a public hackathon.
              I was introduced to Progressive web apps, and what my teammate built in Vue.js was amazing. I think I will look into this
              concept and framework in future projects. It seems capable enough as a "build once" type app, in which it can handle web, 
              and mobile at the same time. I also went deeper into the DialogFlow API and Google Cloud Functions. 
              I was able to program content-rich responses to Google Assistant, in which voice + a carousel of photo and data was shown to the users.

              <h4>
                What we built
              </h4>
              <p>
                I can't go into the specifics, but we used Google's DialogFlow (API.AI at the time) to build a voice
                assistant that interacted with our product. We had to create an "AI Gateway" built in Node.js which
                acted as a passthrough for routing intents from the Voice Assistant, and translated them into
                the appropriate server calls. I created a simple AngularJS component and leveraged the voice libraries
                in HTML5 to prototype a in-app voice assistant, in which Google Assistant wasn't needed.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Technology used:

              <p>
                Google's DialogFlow, Node.js, Spring Boot, AngularJS
              </p>
              <h4>
                Takeaways:
              </h4>
              <p>
                Google's DialogFlow is an amazingly easy to use. It was so natural to build conversation actions, and it had great
                one-click integrations with popular assistant services such as Google Voice Assistant and Alexa.
                It's truly a weapon at hackathons because it doesn't take much time to build one, yet the results are so 
                appealing to the audience because of it's novelty.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>We won best overall!</b> This was the first hackathon I've won and it was a great feeling.
                There was some really great competition and projects, given that this was company-wide with over 300 engineers
                participating.
